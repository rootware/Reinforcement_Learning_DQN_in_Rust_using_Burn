## Introduction
As you can see from my Github, I usually work in applying Reinforcement Learning to physics design problems. The codebase I usually use is owned by the JILA team, implements double deep Q-Networks and is in C++. I usually couple that to my C++ / Rust physics simulations.

This is an ongoing repo where, mostly for my own edification, I implement a deep Q-Network RL in Rust. Goal was to gain solidify my foundation in RL + gain familiarity with the Burn API in Rust for doing ML. Eventually I'd like to make a pure Rust repo where both my RL and my simulations are in Rust.
